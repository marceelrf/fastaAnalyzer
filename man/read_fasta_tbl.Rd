\title{Read a FASTA file into a tibble}
\usage{
read_fasta_tbl(file, keepTag = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Path to the FASTA file to be read.}

\item{keepTag}{Logical (default = `FALSE`). If `FALSE`, the leading `">"`
character in the sequence names is removed. If `TRUE`, the tags are kept as
they appear in the file.}
}
\value{
A `tibble` with the following columns:
\describe{
  \item{sequence_names}{Character vector containing sequence identifiers (tags).}
  \item{sequence}{Character vector containing the corresponding DNA or RNA sequences.}
}
}
\description{
This function reads a FASTA-formatted file and returns a `tibble` with two
columns: one for the sequence names (tags) and one for the corresponding
sequences. It is a simple reader designed for FASTA files where each sequence
is written on a single line.
}
\details{
The function assumes a **two-line FASTA format**, where each record contains:
\enumerate{
  \item A header line starting with `">"` (sequence identifier).
  \item A single line containing the nucleotide or amino acid sequence.
}

It is not suitable for multi-line FASTA entries (where a single sequence spans
multiple lines). For such cases, consider using `Biostrings::readDNAStringSet()`
or `seqinr::read.fasta()`.

\examples{
library(readr)
library(tibble)

# Example: reading a simple FASTA file
# Suppose "example.fasta" contains:
# >seq1
# ATCG
# >seq2
# GGCATTA

fasta_tbl <- read_fasta_tbl("fake.fasta")
print(fasta_tbl)

# Keep the original tags (with ">")
fasta_tbl <- read_fasta_tbl("fake.fasta", keepTag = TRUE)

}
