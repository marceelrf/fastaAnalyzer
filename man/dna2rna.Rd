\title{Convert DNA sequences to RNA sequences}
\usage{
dna2rna(tbl, keepSequence = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{A `data.frame` or `tibble` containing a column named `sequence`
with DNA sequences (character strings).}

\item{keepSequence}{Logical (default = `TRUE`). If `FALSE`, the original
`sequence` column will be removed from the output.}
}
\value{
A `tibble` containing the input data (optionally without the
`sequence` column) and a new column `rna` with the RNA version of each sequence.
}
\description{
This function converts DNA sequences into RNA sequences by replacing all
occurrences of thymine (T) with uracil (U) in a column named `sequence`.
It returns a table containing a new column `rna` with the converted sequences.
}
\details{
The function performs a simple base replacement (`T` â†’ `U`) to simulate
transcription from DNA to RNA. The input column `sequence` must contain
character strings composed of DNA bases (A, T, C, G).
}
\examples{
library(dplyr)

dna_tbl <- tibble::tibble(
  id = 1:3,
  sequence = c("ATCG", "AATTCCGG", "GGGTTTAA")
)

# Convert DNA to RNA and keep the original sequence column
dna2rna(dna_tbl)

# Convert DNA to RNA and remove the original sequence column
dna2rna(dna_tbl, keepSequence = FALSE)

}
